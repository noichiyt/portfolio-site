		<span class="bold">I’m an Artist and Musician from Bay Shore, NY.</span>
		Drawing and being a composer are two things that I have enjoyed doing 
		the most since it allows me to create a bunch of new stuff that hasn’t 
		been created before. It also helps me be able to bring a lot of my stuff 
		to the music and art industry.
